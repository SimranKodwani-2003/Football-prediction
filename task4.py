4. Use model selection approaches discussed in class to choose the best model

From all the above models we can observe that the SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION, reports us the best results as the R2 value of the SVR is lowest among all other regressions. The Best Score of SVR is  -6.099489733412793, Best Hyperparameters: {'gamma': 0.0001, 'kernel': 'rbf', 'max_iter': 100}, Accuracy: 0.2185178234939857, MSE score: 10.47592874913882 and R2 score: 0.39691213061159725
So, Support vector Machine is the best algorithm among all others in this scenario. So we deployed Support Vector Machine Regression in Restful API.
